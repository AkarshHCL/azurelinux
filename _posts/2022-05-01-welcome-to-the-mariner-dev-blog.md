Welcome to the unofficial Mariner Dev Blog. This blog is set up with the intent for the Mariner development team to discuss and highlight the features and changes to the CBL-Mariner distribution for the broader Linux community outside Microsoft. Our intent is to deliver an update to this blog on a roughly monthly cadence from a more technical perspective. We want to outline specific changes, technical reasons behind some of our design decisions, and generally provide some insight into what's happening behind the scenes. 

This blog should not be confused with any sort of official product announcement, or other official Microsoft communication. It is simply a way for our developers to communicate directly with the broader community and to discuss their work in an effort to be more transparent about our development process. 

Thanks for reading, and we hope you'll follow along as we continue to build out our distribution.
