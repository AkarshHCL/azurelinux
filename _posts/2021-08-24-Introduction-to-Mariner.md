Mariner or more exactly CBL-Mariner where CBL stands for *Common Base Linux*, is a Linux distribution created by Microsoft's Linux System Group which is the same team at Microsoft which created the [Linux kernel used for Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel), or WSL2. The goal of Mariner is to be used as an internal Linux distribution for Microsoftâ€™s engineering teams to build cloud infrastructure and edge products and services. 

Of course Mariner is open source and it has its own repo under [Microsoft's GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner) organization. No ISOs or images of Mariner are provided, however the repo has instructions to build them on Ubuntu 18.04. There are a series of prerequisites listed in this [GitHub page](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner/blob/1.0/toolkit/docs/building/prerequisites.md) that roughly include Docker, RPM tools, ISO build tools and Golang, amongst others. 

The build process for an ISO is very straightforward, it relays on pre-compiled RPM packages from [CBL-Mariner package repository](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner/blob/1.0/toolkit/docs/building/prerequisites.md). Since I wanted to install Mariner on my vSphere 7 homelab I choose to create the ISO.

```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner.git
cd CBL-Mariner/toolkit
sudo make iso REBUILD_TOOLS=y REBUILD_PACKAGES=n CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/full.json
```
