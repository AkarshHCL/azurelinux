## Why doesn't this apply?
This vulnerability was fixed with patch CVE-2022-3599.patch

## If this will apply in a newer version of the package? 
No. Right now, version is 4.4.0 and the next version 4.5.0 does not 
have this vulnerability.

## Explanation:
The steps to reproduce this vulnerability are mentioned in link: 
https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/-/issues/277

If we apply CVE-2022-3599.patch on v4.4.0 and perform the same steps, then 
tiffcp will not give `ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow`.
